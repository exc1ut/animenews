In the following year, MAPPA drew more attention from its originality and high-quality performance by continuously producing TV anime series, such as <em>Kids on the Slope</em> and <em>Teekyu</em>.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>In April 2016, Manabu Otsuka, one of the founding members, became MAPPA’s next  president. Within that same year, Director Sunao Katabuchi’s animation feature film, <em>In this Corner of the World</em>, was released. The film’s production funds were raised by crowdfunding and became a success. It remained in theaters for a national record of 1,173 consecutive days and sold more than a total of 2.1 million tickets, which successfully earned a box-office revenue of more than 27 million yen.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>MAPPA continues to produce high-quality works by collaborating with famous directors such as Sunao Katabuchi, Shinichiro Watanabe, and Sayu

House, wanted to establish in order to somehow release <em>In This Corner of the World</em> with Director Sunao Katabuchi.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>Maruyama’s close connection,

initially founded?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> You can say that it was like a group of rowdy pirates (laughs). Before coming to MAPPA, I had been working under Studio4℃’s Ms. Eiko Tanaka so I was frequently shocked by the difference between studios.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>However, I noticed that the company was not too concerned with the specific details. MAPPA had this old-fashioned mindset that supported the idea of \"as long as we produce excellent anime, everything else doesn’t matter too much\".</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>It felt like we were running against the wind because we had many people quitting their previous job to produce \"exceptional\" anime with Katabuchi and Watanabe.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>—Following Madhouse, MAPPA is also known for producing high-quality anime. What are the things that you took over from the Founder Mr. Maruyama?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> His mindset of \"difficult requests are fulfilled with difficult aspirations\". This means that obstacles in front of us may be tough and intimidating, but facing them could help you discover new ideas or accomplish something unexpectedly.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>This anticipation of finding new discoveries is what I have learned from both Mr. Tanaka from STUDIO4℃ and Mr. Maruyama. They were similar in that aspect. That is something that I am aiming to accomplish.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><div class=\"p-article__figure-inner\"><img src=\"https://resize.cdn.otakumode.com/resize/30/u/17e4ba1b1ccf4af599eedb9f27c396be.jpg.webp\" width=\"610\" height=\"407\" class=\"lazy\" data-src=\"https://resize.cdn.otakumode.com/ex/610.407/u/17e4ba1b1ccf4af599eedb9f27c396be.jpg.webp\" lazy=\"loading\"></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>—One of the goals behind the establishment of MAPPA was to produce Director Katabuchi’s <em>In This Corner of the World</em>. How did you respond to his demands?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Otsuka:</strong> What I mean by the word \"difficult\", as I mentioned earlier, are things that  you cannot do normally. Director Katabuchi’s works were \"difficult\" because their plays were very detailed which required many video recordings. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>We understood the purpose behind this after his explanations. However, every time we completed a scene, we were not sure if we had fulfilled all his goals. Mr. Katabuchi’s thought process is far beyond our own.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>Mr. Katabuchi spent his entire life to arrive at this stage, so we understood that this is not what younger generations like us can accomplish easily. We were desperately trying to keep up with him.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>In September 2019, Contrail Corporation was founded as a studio for Mr. Katabuchi’s next anime, and we intend to improve that aspect of the anime production.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>→Next page: “Enjoyable” is the most important driving force.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p></p></div>","image":"https://resize.cdn.otakumode.com/full/u/f5560f0674734458bd45d71e00060023.jpg.webp"},{"title":"Boruto to Resume Broadcasts On Jul. 5!","date":"2020-06-30T23:00:00+00:00","body":"<div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>Ninja anime <a href=\"https://otakumode.com/shop/label/Boruto\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Boruto: Naruto Next Generations</strong></a> will begin broadcasting new episodes again on Jul. 5! </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>The show went on hiatus in April due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

But I don’t know what it is that makes someone good. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/05d506a2c58149e4b850702a3f0ad6e5.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- You’re both still young, but as for the employees and contractors in general you’re a pretty young studio.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Speaking for the animation department, we’re mostly in our 20s. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> You’re at the upper end too. I turned 32 this April and I’m one of the oldest in production. Of course, we have some veterans in their 40s and 50s, but about half are in their early 20s so yeah we’re a pretty young studio. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- So that’s your trademark. It must have advantages?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> I mean it in a nice way, but they all work hard for us. I feel like everyone is pushing themselves and giving it their all. We get some amazing frames, don’t we? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>■ Don’t sleep on Kinema Citrus</strong></p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/6bbf537f50664fec89cd1bce652543a4.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Could we ask a little about your work? You’ve produced some cool series like <em>Made in Abyss</em>,* Starlight Revue*, and <em>The Rising of the Shield Hero</em>. How did that happen? How did you pick them? You must have picked them, right?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> More than anyone else, we’re very conscious that you have to protect the quality. CEO Muneki Ogasawara has always encouraged that in his career and now it feels like it’s coming to fruition in the film. Maybe (lol). </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Young people have a lot of passion. They’re all knuckling down and making stuff. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Is there one of Kinema Citrus’ works that you’d particularly recommend?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Hard question. In the beginning I only knew about <em>Kuma Miko: Girl Meets Bear</em>. (lol). It’s from the early days but also <em>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</em>. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> You watched it in real time. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I’m not good with good stories. I cry (lol). <em>Tokyo Magnitude 8.0</em> really got to me, I still like it now. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- That was the origin of Kinema Citrus. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I think that’s because it has that spiritual quality, but if you ask Ogasawara he might tell you you’re wrong (lol). Then there’s Barakamon. I feel like we have a real variety now. It’s a little different from where we started, because people have changed.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.862/u/8c92516ef0fc4d5c9a5f1e16ed47d8cf.jpg\"><figcaption>© Project Revue Starlight</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- What do you think, Mr. Saita?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Speaking for myself, the revue scenes from <em>Revue Starlight</em> which I worked on. Koide, a natural born animator at Kinema, handled it. He handled the whole thing and the quality is amazing. <br> <br></p><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.858/u/aabb14f54e2345239911ae948ac1cb0c.jpg\"><figcaption>The Rising of the Shield Hero © 2019 Aneko Yusagi / Kadokawa / The Rising of the Shield Hero Production Committee</figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- <em>The Rising of the Shield Hero</em> has been a big hit recently both in Japan and abroad. How did you manage that and what are you hoping for in the future?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Can I just speak for myself a minute? What indeed. (lol). There’s work I want to carry on with. The show we have going now, we haven’t exhausted the source material. We’ve been talking about what to do after that. We’ve worked so hard making it that we want to be able to continue. We’ll keep going, that’s what I’ll say. (lol).</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>Maybe we’re more popular overseas. If you asked if we planned it that way from the beginning, then I think we achieved the objective. There are times when you stray from the plan on purpose, to avoid predictability, and people tell you it’s very “Kinema.” The drama really feels real. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/28ee382c84fc4591b39263f6e9861490.jpg\"><figcaption>Studio specific graffiti on a whiteboard. You can really feel the love for the characters.</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>■ Introduction of digital production, the frontline of production at Kinema Citrus</strong></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Around how many people are involved in-house right now?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Other than here (the Ogikubo HQ), we have another studio at Nishi-Ogikubo. It’s really fulfilling. Here we do coloring to finishing. We also do in-betweens and have a section dedicated to checks. We have about 10 in-betweeners. T2studio (Takahashi Production) handle photography. Color coordination is 50/50. Hiroyuki mentioned Koide before who works with him in animation, he wears many hats and can do animation direction and character design. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> That’s right. Producing and key animation too. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> There are some who can do producing and key animation, but I think you can count them on one hand. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Around five, maybe? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> With the personnel we have now, and the ones who will join us later, as we train them up and the numbers increase, I can see us being able to do a whole episode in-house. We’re aiming for that now. As for production, including the line producer, there are about 20 of us. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/d5db1f16be064e1296b68a15d30cdbaf.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Seems like you’re really growing. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I think we have to. Looking a little further off, in 5 to 10 years time, I think we’ll have increased the lines. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- What about the male/female balance? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Are there more men in production? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> A few. But, the numbers of women are really increasing. There were more women last year than the year before. Last year there were a few. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- You mentioned that you’re transitioning from paper and pencil to drawing on tablets and digital animation. How far along are you with that? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> It seems like Ogasawara wanted to start before I joined the company but they couldn’t do it as well as they wanted. When I was in charge of <em>Made in the Abyss</em>, Satoshi Mori was running a digital animation studio in Gifu called Giftanimation. I took advantage of that too. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>In the beginning I thought it would be easy. We wouldn’t need to send materials or travel far outside of work. But once we started, the production assistant’s job became much more difficult and complicated. We had to digitalize or we couldn’t go on. I wanted to do it because it had its upsides too. We tried out several kinds of production methods with Mori. We tried to do the animation of episode 13 of <em>Made in Abyss</em> digitally as far as we could. There were so many problems, but with the experience we gained <em>The Rising of the Shield Hero</em> was about 60% digital from episode 3. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/3efcf5c978654deeb5e0dc54110890f0.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- What was the reaction from the animators who are actually drawing it?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Even at Kinema Citrus, there were a lot of difficulties when we were trying to proceed with digital animation. It was Saita who explained to us how difficult it was during the meetings. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> When Kinema Citrus was talking about going full digital, Kinema proposed the equipment and software, and the people who’d been using it so far could use it but for the people who had never used it before, even if they understood the terminology, they had no idea how to use it efficiently. Files were all over the place, checks were a pain. We started talking about what we could do about it. It was at that point that we needed to make some rules. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> You draw a little, and then if there’s a problem you go back. I feel like we’ve finally got there now. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> To that extent we came up with the rules and then we were standing at the start line. (lol)</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> In the beginning, Saita said that because we’re doing this at Kinema we needed to put out quality work while creating a system where the amount of work done in a day wouldn’t change from the paper days. Since then there have been a lot of problems, and we solved them, so I think it will go well from now on. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>I’m in production, Saita is in animation, but because we meet properly to talk through problems we can apply the ideas to the work. Kinema’s strength is that when something happens we can come up with a solution. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/28f8686d586e445294b43469c64bdbb1.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- You must work well as a team?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I think we’ve finally perfected a system now. Thinking about the Kinema of 10 or 20 years time, I want the employee turnover to fall. If someone quits, you have to start over from scratch. As we’re finally perfecting digital animation after such a long process, if someone leaves we’ll have to start again from there. It’ll never get finished. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>If we want them to stay, we need to think about a new production method from the point of view of working practices and conditions. Up to now we’ve relied on freelancers but that won’t be possible in future generations. When it goes digital, companies will need to maintain equipment, that will cost money, and to use it properly will require people in the office continually doing good work. We need to change the anime industry, and make sure people stay in it. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>■ Thanks to Twitter, you can participate in the Revue Starlight animation from overseas</strong><br> <br></p><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/e8eb04af0b5841a6a6203ba8649496d1.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br> <br>- Are there any employees from overseas at Kinema Citrus?<p></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Someone joined this year.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> From other parts of Asia, but yes there are. There’s someone from China working in production. He joined the company right out of technical school. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Last year we had a girl from France intern with us to train in animation. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Would you like to recruit more staff from abroad if the opportunity arose?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> There’s no need to restrict yourself to people with Japanese citizenship. There might be a language barrier, but that’s not such an issue for animators. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> It might be difficult with the language problem in production where communication is key, but it doesn’t really matter for animation. I taught an in-betweener from Taiwan once, but it wasn’t any different than teaching someone from Japan. The conversation might have been a little halting, but the passion was the same. Maybe, the overseas students are keener even (lol).</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> If you’ve left your country and come to Japan just for that then you must have real resolve.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> I think that’s probably true. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Japanese anime is really popular overseas, have you had any responses from international viewers?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> You really get a lot on Twitter.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Yes. Ogasawara gets a lot of responses to <em>Revue Starlight</em> on his Twitter feed. We get fan letters from overseas too. <em>Made in Abyss</em> is really popular overseas.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.879/u/83896955276a4d39a549c4fe7fa664de.jpg\"><figcaption>Made in Abyss © 2017 Akihito Tsukushi, Takeshobo / Made in Abyss Production Committee</figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Do you make the shows with overseas fans in mind?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> No. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I don’t either. Rather than country, I think it’s better to say anime fandom. Rather being aimed at someone in particular, someone watching, someone who is interested, even if it’s just one person watching a lot that’s enough. Come, wherever you’re coming from (lol). Wherever you’re from, fight. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- What if someone offered you work overseas? “Hey, come do character design for us!”, would you do it?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Sure! Though I don’t know if they want Japanese anime style overseas. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- I think you’d be OK across Asia.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> I see illustrations from illustrators all over the world on Twitter, etc., and they’re almost identical to ones by Japanese illustrators, it’s amazing! We’ve got animators from overseas working on key animation for us right now. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> There are a few people working on <em>Revue Starlight</em> overseas. Ogasawara put out a want ad on his Twitter. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Do you have anything to say to international fans? </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Please watch <em>Made in Abyss</em>!</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Your expectations are high but I think we can meet them. The anime production method is taking a step forward, so look out for that. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>■ Doing all kinds of things, Kinema Citrus’ future</strong></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p></p><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/a571a821c36b4e74b2d838ff75153926.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><br> <br>- Could we ask a little about the future?<p></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> I want to make a hit! (lol). “This is our masterpiece” - that kind of thing!</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Me too. Something that will become a pillar we can build the company around so it can continue. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Like <em>Dragon Ball</em> for Toei, or <em>Gundam</em> for Sunrise. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> If we can stabilize just by doing that, then we’ll be able to train people too. I want to get rid of all the bad stories you hear about the anime production environment. To do that requires money though, so we need a big hit that can support us. We’ve made a lot of good shows, but we need to take it further. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Can I ask a big question? Where do you think Japanese anime is headed? Are there any trends?</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Hmm, what’s going to happen? I’d like to know. If I knew that I could make a hit!<br> <br></p><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/eeeb846a9c644d8da49a06efc21eca09.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p></p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- What about pictures? Once there was a time that lines had really increased, but these days they’re pretty slim.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> There are a lot of motion heavy shows lately so the lines have become simpler. I grew up loving bishoujo anime so my lines are a little bigger (lol). </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> I grew up watching movies and TV drama so I think if you can make something that has real soul so that people can get lost in the story then they’ll keep coming back to it. That’s somewhere between a hope and prediction. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Saita:</strong> Recently, people have been remaking old properties. We’ve gone back a little to the way things used to look. So you could say that’s the trend. However, Kinema doesn’t have a characteristic kind of show. We make all kinds of things. We even do fantasy - anything. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> There’s space for everything so you can make anything. It’s good to maintain diversity. You get more experience by making different kinds of shows. In a company with a broad outlook, animators can become all-rounders and I think that’s a good thing. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>- Thank you.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><strong>Harada:</strong> Finally, I’d just like to announce that we’ve started recruiting new graduates for this year’s intake. We’re doing an orientation session for the first time. We want to strengthen recruitment, production, and animation. It doesn’t matter where you’re from, or how old you are. We want to make edgy work. If you’re the kind of person who can open their own doors, please come and knock on ours. We’d love to work with you. Though, as we’re only going to get bigger, it would be really great to find some people with drive. </p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><figure><img src=\"https://d3ieicw58ybon5.cloudfront.net/ex/610.407/u/a040bd939dcd408b942651c63d9987b4.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p></p></div>","image":"https://resize.cdn.otakumode.com/ex/1600.1066/u/8e35fc7df3f34d13b72e635a94e9169f.jpg.webp"},{"title":"Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These Seiran Releases 2-Minute Trailer!","date":"2019-10-03T03:30:00+00:00","body":"<div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>With less than three weeks to go until the premiere of Part 2, <a href=\"https://otakumode.com/shop/label/Legend%20of%20the%20Galactic%20Heroes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These</strong></a>'s movie trilogy has revealed a new two-minute trailer!</p></div><div class=\"p-article__inner\"><div class=\"c-video-responsive\"><iframe width=\"750\" height=\"420\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2KciYnYsAGI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p>The trailer shows the increasingly fierce internal conflict within both the Empire and the Alliance.</p></div><div class=\"p-article__text\"><p><a href=\"https://otakumode.com/shop/label/Legend%20of%20the%20Galactic%20Heroes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Legend of the Galactic Heroes: Die Neue These</strong></a> is inspired by Tanaka Yoshiki’s popular science fiction novels.
